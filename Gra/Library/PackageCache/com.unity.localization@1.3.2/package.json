  "description": "Use the Localization package to easily configure localization settings for your application.\n\nAdd support for multiple languages and regional variants, including:\n\n• String localization: Set different strings to display based on locale. Use the Smart Strings feature to add logic to automatically replace specific strings, such as placeholders and plurals.\n• Asset localization: Use a different asset (such as a texture, model, or audio file) based on a locale.\n• Pseudo-localization: Test how your project will adapt to different localizations at an early stage, before adding your translations.\n• Import and export localization data to XLIFF, CSV and Google Sheets.\n\nAdd localization to your projects using the Localization package to help make your applications more accessible to a wider audience.",

([LOC-540](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-540))\n- Disabled fix for \"New localization assets created automatically and/or old assets are modified when loading project without Library folder ([LOC-400](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-400))\" on Unity 2019.4 to 2021.3. This is due to a bug in Addressables (ADDR-2521). This fix will be re-enabled in the future. (LOC-704)\n- Updated dependency `com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json` to 2.0.2.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed `NullReferenceException` when creating a new table that takes name from renamed table. ([LOC-550](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/nullreferenceexception-creating-a-table-that-takes-name-from-renamed-table))\n- Fixed `GameObjectLocalizer` failing to apply local asset references in Unity versions before 2022.2. ([LOC-714](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-714))\n- Fixed `LocalizedStringTable` and `LocalizedAssetTable` property drawer not setting `GUI.changed` when the reference was changed. ([LOC-725](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-725))\n- Fixed Asset Tables being destroyed during preloading. ([LOC-727](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-727))\n- Improved `FormatException` error message when `String.Format` throws during `GetLocalizedString`.\n- String Table entries will no longer try to use `String.Format` when using `GetLocalizedString` with non-null but empty arguments.
